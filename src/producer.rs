/// Mode could be switched using [`Self::postponed`]/[`Self::into_postponed`] and [`Self::into_immediate`] methods.

/// + In immediate mode removed and inserted items are automatically synchronized with the other end.
/// + In postponed mode synchronization occurs only when [`Self::sync`] or [`Self::into_immediate`] is called or when `Self` is dropped.
///   The reason to use postponed mode is that multiple subsequent operations are performed faster due to less frequent cache synchronization.
